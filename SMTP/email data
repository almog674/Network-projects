Running In the Rain

I walking on the same street
and he's looking like he looks every day
I didn't know what I looking for
Until I lost my way and  drops start to fall



Pre Corus
Even if I close my Eyes The Clouds will be keeping grey
The rain will fall to the ground until I find my way
In a beautiful city but its cool all around
I walking just for half hour and I already hate the sound

Corus
I running in the rain rinning in the rain
I got old memories and now I Chain now I chain
My arms are getting cold and I feel a pain and feel a pain
Corus again


this street is full of people but empty of life
you can cut this silence with a knife
They seem to be chasing something important and special
But when the rain begins you just searching for something simple
just warm place between your hands
A beautiful kingdom made of stones and sand
A place where the snow is never coming down
And if you are the queen I want to hold the crown.
where I never miss you and you never go
where the rainbow doesn't need a floot to show
where it's never rain and the sun always shines
because every time you smile the Stars are stand in a line

chorus

I did a lot of steps on this wet sidewalk
and I still wonder if you miss our talks
your hair is like a wonderful river
your skin is glowing more than silver
and I see you when I looking into the sky
cause I see all the colors hiding in your eyes
I want you to run with me and to take my hand
cause I want to be there every time you sad
